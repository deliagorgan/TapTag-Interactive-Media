# TapTag | Interactive Image Sharing Platform

TapTag is a full-stack social media application that redefines how users interact with visual content. Unlike traditional platforms, TapTag allows creators to define **interactive hotspots** on images, bridging the gap between static media and dynamic user engagement.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Image Editor:** A custom-built workspace for drawing and configuring interactive regions on uploaded images.
- **Advanced Image Processing:** A Python microservice dedicated to image manipulation and steganography.
- **Real-time Engagement:** Live notifications and social feed updates using modern async patterns.
- **Secure Infrastructure:** URL verification via Google Safe Browsing API and optimized media storage with Cloudinary.
- **Financial Integration:** Complete payment flow implementation using Stripe API for creator support.

## Architecture & Tech Stack
The project follows a microservices-inspired architecture to ensure separation of concerns and scalability:

- **Frontend:** React.js, React-Bootstrap.
- **Primary Backend:** Node.js (Express) with Sequelize ORM.
- **Image Microservice:** Python (Flask), Stegano, Pillow.
- **Database:** MySQL.
- **External Services:** Cloudinary (Media), Stripe (Payments), Google Cloud (Security).



## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v20+)
- Python (v3.12+)
- MySQL Server

### 1. Clone & Install
```bash
git clone
cd taptag
npm install
npm install --prefix frontend
npm install --prefix backend
pip install -r backend/pythin_server/requirements.txt
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
Create a .env file in the root directory based on the .env.example template provided. You will need to provide your own API keys for:

Database: Host, Username, Password.

Media: Cloudinary credentials.

Payments: Stripe Secret Key and Webhook Secret.

Security: Google Safe Browsing API Key.

### 3. Database Migration
Ensure your MySQL server is running, then execute the following command to set up the schema:

```bash
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
```
### 4. Running the Application
The project is configured for a streamlined development experience. Launch all services (Frontend, Node.js, and Python) simultaneously with a single command:

```bash
npm run start-all
```
## Technical Challenges Overcome
### 🔐 Invisible Data Embedding via LSB Steganography
The core innovation of TapTag is the ability to persist interactive hotspot metadata directly within the image file itself, rather than relying solely on external databases.
- **The Challenge:** Storing complex JSON structures (coordinates, types, labels) inside an image without affecting its visual integrity or file size.
- **The Solution:** I engineered a robust steganography engine using the **LSB (Least Significant Bit)** technique. By converting JSON metadata into Base64 strings and injecting them into the least significant bits of the image's pixel data, I achieved "invisible" persistence. This ensures that even if the image is downloaded, the interactive data remains embedded within the binary.

State Management: Handling complex UI states and coordinate mapping within the custom-built interactive image editor.

System Security: Implementing robust data validation and third-party security checks to protect users from malicious embedded URLs.
