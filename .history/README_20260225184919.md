# TapTag | Interactive Image Sharing Platform

TapTag is a full-stack social media application that redefines how users interact with visual content. Unlike traditional platforms, TapTag allows creators to define **interactive hotspots** on images, bridging the gap between static media and dynamic user engagement.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Image Editor:** A custom-built workspace for drawing and configuring interactive regions on uploaded images.
- **Advanced Image Processing:** A Python microservice dedicated to image manipulation and steganography.
- **Real-time Engagement:** Live notifications and social feed updates using modern async patterns.
- **Secure Infrastructure:** URL verification via Google Safe Browsing API and optimized media storage with Cloudinary.
- **Financial Integration:** Complete payment flow implementation using Stripe API for creator support.

## Architecture & Tech Stack
The project follows a microservices-inspired architecture to ensure separation of concerns and scalability:

- **Frontend:** React.js, React-Bootstrap.
- **Primary Backend:** Node.js (Express) with Sequelize ORM.
- **Image Microservice:** Python (Flask), Stegano, Pillow.
- **Database:** MySQL.
- **External Services:** Cloudinary (Media), Stripe (Payments), Google Cloud (Security).



## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v20+)
- Python (v3.12+)
- MySQL Server

### 1. Clone & Install
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/taptag.git](https://github.com/yourusername/taptag.git)
cd taptag
npm install
npm install --prefix frontend
npm install --prefix backend
pip install -r backend/server_python/requirements.txt

2. Environment Configuration
Create a .env file in the root directory based on the .env.example template provided. You will need to provide your own API keys for:

Database: Host, Username, Password.

Media: Cloudinary credentials.

Payments: Stripe Secret Key and Webhook Secret.

Security: Google Safe Browsing API Key.

3. Database Migration
Ensure your MySQL server is running, then execute the following command to set up the schema:

Bash
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
4. Running the Application
The project is configured for a streamlined development experience. Launch all services (Frontend, Node.js, and Python) simultaneously with a single command:

Bash
npm run start-all
📈 Technical Challenges Overcome
Cross-Service Communication: Synchronizing the Node.js main server with the Python microservice for heavy image processing tasks using RESTful patterns.

State Management: Handling complex UI states and coordinate mapping within the custom-built interactive image editor.

System Security: Implementing robust data validation and third-party security checks to protect users from malicious embedded URLs.
